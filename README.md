# CurfewBot
A Discord bot intended to provide server administrators with a near-fully customizable lockdown procedure that can be activated (and deactivated) for scheduled intervals of time. This bot is *not necessarily designed with broader public use in mind*, and is instead tailored to the needs of PCS2024 and related communities. 

## Selfhosting
When the bot is in a usable state, instructions will be written here on how to selfhost an instance of the bot.
PCS2024 will be running its own instance, and in most cases running your own will not be necessary (and will not use our synchronized schedule).
